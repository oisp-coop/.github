We are OISP â€“ a collective of independent Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who have come together to build a better internet for everyone. 

At the heart of our mission is a firm belief: internet access is an undeniable human right. We champion a vision of the internet as a powerful tool for empowerment, ensuring that every individual can connect, engage, and thrive in today's digital world. 

As a member-owned cooperative, our vision starts with a commitment to open-source software built on open standards. Our methodology is rooted in empowering citizens to take an active role in their digital lives. 


Our mission starts today. Join us in building a better internet.
